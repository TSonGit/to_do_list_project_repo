# to_do_list_project_repo
This repository will hold my code for a To-Do list personal project. It will be written primarily in Javascript and EJS.

# Purpose
This is a personal project I am creating to challenge myself. I wanted to create a functional To-Do List that I 
could see myself using. This is also a challenge to remind myself of how the interworkings of HTML, CSS, and EJS
come together to create a webpage. 

# Design Ideas
My design ideas and potential functionality are logged in my [Notes](https://github.com/TSonGit/to_do_list_project_repo/blob/main/notes.txt).
